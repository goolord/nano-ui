# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Scroll tuning: `setScrollTuning` sets how far a wheel notch scrolls
  (`scrollWheelStep`) and how long a scroll takes to settle
  (`scrollSmoothTime`, `0` for no glide). `setScrollStep` gives one scroller
  its own step.
- Scroll commands: `scrollTo`, `scrollBy`, `scrollPages`, `scrollToStart`,
  `scrollToEnd`, `scrollIntoView` and `scrollRectIntoView`, each landing at
  once or gliding (`ScrollInstant` / `ScrollSmooth`).
- `getScrollMetrics` reports a scroller's viewport, offset and reachable
  range, which is what a virtualized list needs to pick the rows it builds.

### Changed

- A wheel notch scrolls three text lines instead of one, matching what
  desktops send a notch as. `setScrollTuning` puts it back.

## 0.1.0.0
