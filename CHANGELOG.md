# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Scoped styling: `styled f` draws the widgets inside it with the theme
  modified by `f`, and `themed t` with another theme. Scopes nest, only
  affect how widgets look, and `uiTheme` reads the theme where it is called.
- Style modifiers (`background`, `foreground`, `borderColor`, `borderWidth`,
  `cornerRadius`, `hoverBackground`, `pressBackground`, `fillColor`) and
  theme modifiers (`buttonStyle`, `inputStyle`, `panelStyle`, `windowStyle`,
  `everyStyle`, `accentColor`, `textColor`, `mutedColor`, `linkColor`,
  `selectionColor`, `windowColor`, `rounded`), composed with `(.)`.
- Button variants as theme modifiers: `primary`, `destructive`, `success`,
  `subtle`, and `tinted` for any theme colour.
- `disabledWhen` disables the widgets inside it: they keep their layout and
  state, take no pointer or keyboard input, leave the focus order, and draw
  with `disabledTheme`.
- Undo and redo in every text field: Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z and Ctrl+Y, and
  Undo and Redo rows in the right-click menu. Typing is undone a word at a
  time and a run of deletes at once. Steps keep the edits, not copies of the
  document.
- `TextCommand` and `TextMotion`: what text fields do, as values. Keys and
  the context menu run them, and `runTextCommand` runs them on a field by its
  id, with `textCanUndo` and `textCanRedo` for enabling menu items.
- SVG icons: `parseSvg` and `loadSvg` read the static subset of SVG icon
  sets use (paths, basic shapes, groups, transforms, strokes with caps and
  joins, fill rules, opacity), and `svgIcon` and `svgIconWith` draw one. A
  one-colour icon is tinted with the text colour or a `fontColor`. Each
  document is rasterized with anti-aliasing once per pixel size and colour,
  at the display's scale, into the image atlas.
- `spinner`, an indeterminate loading indicator that repaints only its own
  rect while it turns.
- Theme slots `themeOnAccent`, `themeSelection`, `themeFocusRing`,
  `themeLink`, `themeShadow` and `themeDisabledFade`, which replace colours
  that were fixed in the painters.

- Scroll tuning: `setScrollTuning` sets how far a wheel notch scrolls
  (`scrollWheelStep`) and how long a scroll takes to settle
  (`scrollSmoothTime`, `0` for no glide). `setScrollStep` gives one scroller
  its own step.
- Scroll commands: `scrollTo`, `scrollBy`, `scrollPages`, `scrollToStart`,
  `scrollToEnd`, `scrollIntoView` and `scrollRectIntoView`, each landing at
  once or gliding (`ScrollInstant` / `ScrollSmooth`).
- `getScrollMetrics` reports a scroller's viewport, offset and reachable
  range, which is what a virtualized list needs to pick the rows it builds.

### Changed

- `panelStyled` and `panelStyledWith` are gone; use
  `styled (panelStyle (background bg . borderColor border))` around a panel.
  `callout` tints the theme's panel colour instead of a fixed dark grey.
- `uiTheme` returns the theme of the enclosing `styled` scope.
- `MenuAction` is gone; `takeTextEditLastAction` now reports the
  `TextCommand` a text field's menu ran.
- Text areas keep their document as a finger tree of lines and repaint only
  the lines in view, so a keystroke in a 100,000-line document costs about
  1.4 ms on the headless profiler instead of about 26 ms.

- A wheel notch scrolls three text lines instead of one, matching what
  desktops send a notch as. `setScrollTuning` puts it back.
